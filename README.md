# Binary Trees - Visualization and Operations

## Description

This Java project provides a visual implementation of binary trees, allowing users to perform operations such as node insertion, querying, searching, and cleaning. The intuitive graphical interface facilitates interaction, and operations are reflected in real-time in the graphical representation of the tree. Additionally, a validation feature has been implemented to ensure that only integers are entered. Useful for understanding and practicing concepts related to binary trees.

## Key Features

- **Node Insertion:** Add nodes to the binary tree.
- **Inorder, Postorder, and Preorder Queries:** Perform queries using different traversal methods.
- **Search for Specific Nodes:** Find specific nodes in the tree.
- **Real-time Graphical Visualization:** Observe the graphical representation that updates as operations are performed.
- **Integer Validation:** Ensure only integers are entered.
- **Cleaning Operation:** Reset the tree to start anew.

## Usage Instructions

1. Run the application.
2. Use the buttons to perform various operations on the tree.
3. Observe the graphical representation of the tree that updates in real-time.
4. Explore and experiment with binary trees interactively!

## Technologies Used
